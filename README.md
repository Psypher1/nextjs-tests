## Finding A CMS - Part 0

This project is part of my Finding A CMS series on my blog. Before I attach any backend, I built this locally to see if it could be done

The post data is being pulled from an `article.js` file root

### My Concerns

While it works I have concerns as to how I accomplished it. Particularly with the rendering of the single post page.

If you navigate to it: `src/pages/blog/[slug].js`, you'll see its a mess

I am most certain there is a better way to do it, I just don't knoow how.
